Hello there, dear traveler! Welcome to the Hyprland Wiki!

Take a tour of the pages on the left and read ones that you may need.

## Wayland info (especially useful for Xorg users)

A Wayland compositor is a fully autonomous Display Server, like Xorg itself. 
It is **not** possible to mix'n'match Wayland compositors like you could on Xorg
with window managers and compositors.

Calling a Wayland compositor a *"window manager"* is a sin.
I hope you are aware of that going forward.
