## Switchable keyboard layouts

An example of a switchable keyboard layout between US and RU, where you switch
between them with SUPER+A (SUPER+Ð¤)

```
bind=SUPER,A,exec,hyprctl keyword input:kb_layout ru
bind=SUPER,Cyrillic_ef,exec,hyprctl keyword input:kb_layout us
```

You can apply this to any number of languages, mix'n'match, etc.

Please note that if a keyboard layout has a different alphabet, mappings for "a"
"b" "c" will be replaced with mappings from that language. (meaning, e.g.
<key>SUPER</key> + <key>D</key> will not work on a `ru` layout, because the russian layout does not
have a <key>D</key>.)

After Hyprland v0.10.3beta, the above statement may be false. Hyprland (since *after* v0.10.3beta) will now ALWAYS use the global xkb settings for keybind parsing.

Thus, if you have a global layout set to `us`, and per-keyboard layout as `ru`, your keyboard's layout will be russian, but the keybinds will parse based on
the `us` layout (e.g. <key>SUPER</key> + <key>E</key>)

If you are unsure about the key names of your chosen alphabet, refer to the
[xkbcommon keysym header](https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h).
The keysym name in Hyprland is the XKB define name without the `XKB_KEY_`.

Generally, for switched layouts, it's recommended to bind by a keycode.

For proper switching, or avoiding problems / bugs, it's recommended to switch per-device configs instead of global ones.

See [per-device input configs](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Advanced-config/#per-device-input-configs).

## Disabling keybinds with one master keybind

If you want to disable all keybinds with another keybind (make a kaybind toggle
of sorts) you can just use a submap with only a keybind to exit it.

```
bind=MOD,KEY,submap,clean
submap=clean
bind=MOD,KEY,submap,reset
submap=reset
```
